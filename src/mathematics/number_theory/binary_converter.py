# Assignment: Binary Converter
# Description
# Write a script converting from binary to decimal numbers and from decimal
# to binary numbers. The converter should expect two numbers in one line
# separated by single space. First of them is a number to covert, and the
# second one is information about the actual system (2 or 10). Program prints
#  two values - converted number and information about number system after
# conversion (2 or 10), also separated with one space.
#
# Examples

# Input:
#
# 4583 10

# 0001000111100111 2
# Additional feature:
# Numbers after conversion are printed in the formatted table, like the
# following one:
