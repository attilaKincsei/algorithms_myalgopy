## [Sum by factors](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54d496788776e49e6b00052f/train/python)
 
Given an array of positive or negative integers

I= [i1,..,in]

you have to produce a sorted array P of the form

[ [p, sum of all ij of I for which p is a prime factor (p positive) of ij] ...]

P will be sorted by increasing order of the prime numbers. The final result has to be given as a string in Java, C#, C, C++ and as an array of arrays in other languages.

Example:

I = [12, 15] # result = [[2, 12], [3, 27], [5, 15]]
[2, 3, 5] is the list of all prime factors of the elements of I, hence the result.

Notes:

It can happen that a sum is 0 if some numbers are negative!
Example: I = [15, 30, -45] 5 divides 15, 30 and (-45) so 5 appears in the result, the sum of the numbers for which 5 is a factor is 0 so we have [5, 0] in the result amongst others.

In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use dynamically allocated character strings.



## [Going to zero or infinity?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55a29405bc7d2efaff00007c/train/python)

Consider the following numbers (where n! is factorial(n)):

u1 = (1 / 1!) * (1!)
u2 = (1 / 2!) * (1! + 2!)
u3 = (1 / 3!) * (1! + 2! + 3!)
un = (1 / n!) * (1! + 2! + 3! + ... + n!)
Which will win: 1 / n! or (1! + 2! + 3! + ... + n!)?

Are these numbers going to 0 because of 1/n! or to infinity due to the sum of factorials or to another number?

Task
Calculate (1 / n!) * (1! + 2! + 3! + ... + n!) for a given n, where n is an integer greater or equal to 1.

To avoid discussions about rounding, return the result truncated to 6 decimal places, for example:

1.0000989217538616 will be truncated to 1.000098
1.2125000000000001 will be truncated to 1.2125
Remark
Keep in mind that factorials grow rather rapidly, and you need to handle large inputs.


## [Time Delta](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-time-delta/problem)

When users post an update on social media,such as a URL, image, status update etc., other users in their network are able to view this new post on their news feed. Users can also see exactly when the post was published, i.e, how many hours, minutes or seconds ago.

Since sometimes posts are published and viewed in different time zones, this can be confusing. You are given two timestamps of one such post that a user can see on his newsfeed in the following format:

Day dd Mon yyyy hh:mm:ss +xxxx

Here +xxxx represents the time zone. Your task is to print the absolute difference (in seconds) between them.

Input Format

The first line contains , the number of testcases. 
Each testcase contains  lines, representing time  and time .

Constraints

Input contains only valid timestamps
.
Output Format

Print the absolute difference  in seconds.

Explanation 0

In the first query, when we compare the time in UTC for both the time stamps, we see a difference of 7 hours. which is  seconds or  seconds.

Similarly, in the second query, time difference is 5 hours and 30 minutes for time zone adjusting for that we have a difference of 1 day and 30 minutes. Or
